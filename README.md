**HOUSE PRICING PREDICTIVE MODEL**

**RESEARCH QUESTION**

As a Data Scientist for Hass Consulting Company, which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience, I have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

**METRIS FOR SUCCESS**

Find the factors that affect the housing prices.

Create a model with a 85% prediction accuracy.

**UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXT**

Different factors affect the cost of a house. Numerous factors that affect the pricing arise daily creating a demand for real estate businesses to accurately predict the prices.

**EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN**

Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.

Read and explore the given dataset.

Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.

Performing regression analysis.
